## Key Components

### GenerationPipeline

The `GenerationPipeline` class provides a streamlined interface for text generation using pre-trained language models within the JAX framework.

```python
import easydel as ed
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

model, params = ed.AutoEasyDeLModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(...)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(...)

pipeline = ed.GenerationPipeline(model=model, params=params, tokenizer=tokenizer)
```

### ApiEngine

`ApiEngine` is a Serve API Engine for production purposes, providing a stable and efficient API.

```python
import easydel as ed

pipeline = ed.ChatPipeline(...)
engine = ed.ApiEngine(pipeline=pipeline, hostname="0.0.0.0", port=11550)
engine.fire()
```

### EasyDeLState

`EasyDeLState` acts as a comprehensive container for your EasyDeL model, including training progress, model parameters, and optimizer information.

```python
from easydel import EasyDeLState

state = EasyDeLState.from_pretrained(
    pretrained_model_name_or_path="model_name",
    dtype=jnp.bfloat16,
    param_dtype=jnp.bfloat16,
    sharding_axis_dims=(1, -1, 1, 1)
)
```
