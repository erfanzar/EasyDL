# Installing EasyDeL

EasyDeL uses FJFormer and JAX as main dependencies in order to run the scripts but there are some things that needs to be installed such as GO-lang to JAX specific platform installations, but you can simply install EasyDeL via pip:

```
pip install easydel
```

## Installing Jax

JAX uses XLA to compile and run your NumPy programs on GPUs and TPUs. Compilation happens under the hood by default, with library calls getting just-in-time compiled and executed. But JAX also lets you just-in-time compile your own Python functions into XLA-optimized kernels using a one-function API, jit.


you can install other version too but easydel required at least version of 0.4.16

### TPU

```shell
!pip install jax[tpu] -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/libtpu_releases.html -q
```

### GPU


#### CUDA-12

```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
# CUDA 12 installation
# Note: wheels only available on linux.
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

#### CUDA-11

```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
# CUDA 11 installation
# Note: wheels only available on linux.
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda11_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```


## Installing GO

#### Note this Library needs golang to run (for some tracking stuff on TPU/GPU/CPU)

#### Ubuntu GO installation

```shell
sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install golang -y 
```

#### Manjaro/Arch GO installation

```shell
sudo pacman -Syyuu go
```
